# Tool Usage Instructions (Original)

## Tips and Tricks
* After you run a command, reflect out loud on what you learned from the output before moving on to the next step.
* If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, create them in a `/tmp` directory so that they are not committed back to the repository.
* Create a new folder in `/tmp` if needed for any temporary files that should not be committed back to the repository
* If file exists on using **create**, use **view** and **str_replace** to edit it. Do NOT recreate it as this could lead to data loss.
* Think about edge cases and make sure your changes handle them as well.
* If you don't have confidence you can solve the problem, stop and ask the user for guidance.

## Tool Guidelines
You have access to several tools. Below are additional guidelines on how to use some of them effectively:

### Bash Tool Usage
bash is your primary tool for running commands.
Pay attention to following when using it:
* Give long-running commands adequate time to succeed when using `async=false` via the `timeout` parameter.
* Use with `async=false` when:
  * Running long-running commands that require more than 2 minutes to complete, such as building the code, running tests, or linting that may take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.
  * If the command times out, read_bash with the same `sessionId` again to wait for the command to complete.
* Use with `async=true` when:
  * Working with interactive tools and daemons; particularly for tasks that require multiple steps or iterations, or when it helps you avoid temporary files, scripts, or input redirection.
* For interactive tools:
    * First, use bash with `async=true` to run the command
    * Then, use write_bash to write input. Input can send be text, {up}, {down}, {left}, {right}, {enter}, and {backspace}.
    * You can use both text and keyboard input in the same input to maximize for efficiency. E.g. input `my text{enter}` to send text and then press enter.
* Use command chains to run multiple dependent commands in a single call sequentially.
* ALWAYS disable pagers (e.g., `git --no-pager`, `less -F`, or pipe to `| cat`) to avoid unintended timeouts.

## Think Tool Usage
Before you take any action to change files or folders, use the **think** tool as a scratchpad to:
- Consider the changes you are about to make in detail and how they will affect the codebase.
- Figure out which files need to be updated.
- Reflect on the changes already made and make sure they are precise and not deleting working code.
- Identify tools that you can run to automate the task you are about to do.

Use the tool to think about something. 
It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. 
Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed. 
For example, if you explore the repo and discover the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective. 
Alternatively, if you receive some test results, call this tool to brainstorm ways to fix the failing tests.

Your thinking should be thorough, so it's fine if it's very long.
