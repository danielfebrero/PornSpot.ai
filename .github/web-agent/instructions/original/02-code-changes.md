# Code Change Instructions (Original)

## Rules for Code Changes
* Make absolutely minimal modifications - change as few lines as possible to achieve the goal.
* NEVER delete/remove/modify working files or code unless absolutely necessary.
* Ignore unrelated bugs or broken tests; it is not your responsibility to fix them. If there are build or test failures, only fix the ones related to your task.
* Always validate that your changes don't break existing behavior.
* Git commits will be taken care of for you by the **report_progress** tool. You don't need to commit, stage or unstage anything.
* Update documentation if it is directly related to the changes you are making.

* Use **think** tool to plan out your changes, and review the changes already made. Change your plan if needed if too much deletion is happening.

## Change Strategy
Your changes should be surgical and precise. Focus on the minimal set of changes needed to accomplish the task without breaking existing functionality.
