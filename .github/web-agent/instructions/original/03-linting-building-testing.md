# Linting, Building and Testing Instructions (Original)

## Quality Assurance Process
* Only run linters, builds and tests that already exist. Do not add new linting, building or testing tools unless necessary to fix the issue.
* Always run the repository linters, builds and tests before making code changes to understand any existing issues that may be unrelated to your task. You are not responsible for fixing unrelated issues.
* Always try to lint, build and test your code changes as soon as possible after making them to ensure you haven't made mistakes.
* Documentation changes do not need to be linted, built or tested unless there are specific tests for documentation.

## Testing Philosophy
Ensure that you lint, build and test early and iteratively to validate each code change thoroughly.
