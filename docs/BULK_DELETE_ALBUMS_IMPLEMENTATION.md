# Bulk Delete Albums Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

The bulk delete albums feature has been successfully implemented for admin users. Here's what was added:

### Backend Components

1. **Type Definition** (`backend/shared/types/index.ts`)

   - Added `BulkDeleteAlbumsRequest` interface

2. **Lambda Function** (`backend/functions/admin/albums/bulk-delete.ts`)

   - Handles bulk deletion of up to 50 albums at once
   - Validates all album IDs are strings
   - Processes each album deletion individually with error handling
   - Removes media from albums (preserves media for other albums)
   - Cleans up comments and interactions for each album
   - Returns detailed success/failure results
   - Uses proper GSI queries, no table scans

3. **API Endpoint** (`template.yaml`)

   - `DELETE /admin/albums/bulk-delete`
   - Requires admin authorization
   - 5-minute timeout for bulk operations
   - 512MB memory for bulk processing
   - Only requires `dynamodb:Query` and `dynamodb:DeleteItem` permissions

4. **Unit Tests** (`backend/__tests__/unit/functions/admin/albums/bulk-delete.test.ts`)
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
   - Tests validation, success cases, partial failures, and error handling

### Key Features

- **Efficient Operations**: Uses only DynamoDB queries via GSI1 and direct key operations
- **No Table Scans**: Follows best practices by avoiding expensive scan operations
- **Batch Limits**: Maximum 50 albums per request to prevent timeouts
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing even if some albums fail
- **Detailed Results**: Returns success/failure status for each album
- **Media Preservation**: Removes albums but preserves media files for other albums
- **Complete Cleanup**: Removes comments, likes, bookmarks, and all interactions

### Database Operations Used

1. `DynamoDBService.getAlbum(albumId)` - Direct key lookup
2. `DynamoDBService.listAlbumMedia(albumId, 1000)` - Query on main table
3. `DynamoDBService.deleteAllCommentsForTarget(albumId)` - Query on GSI1
4. `DynamoDBService.deleteAllInteractionsForTarget(albumId)` - Query on GSI1
5. `DynamoDBService.removeMediaFromAlbum()` - Direct key operations
6. `DynamoDBService.deleteAlbum()` - Direct key operation

All operations use efficient queries and key lookups - no table scans required.

### API Usage

The frontend can now call:

```typescript
// Bulk delete multiple albums
await adminAlbumsApi.bulkDeleteAlbums(["album-1", "album-2", "album-3"]);
```

The API returns detailed results:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "3 albums deleted successfully",
    "results": {
      "successfullyDeleted": ["album-1", "album-2", "album-3"],
      "failedDeletions": [],
      "totalMediaRemoved": 15,
      "totalProcessed": 3,
      "successCount": 3,
      "failureCount": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Media Removal**: Removes all media from an album concurrently
- **Batch Operations**: Uses DynamoDB batch operations where possible
- **Efficient Queries**: Leverages GSI1 for comment and interaction cleanup
- **Limited Scope**: Prevents timeouts by limiting to 50 albums per request

The implementation is production-ready and follows all established patterns in the codebase.
