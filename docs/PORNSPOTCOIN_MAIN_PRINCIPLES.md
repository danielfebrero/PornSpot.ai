# PornSpotCoin (PSC) - Main Principles & Architecture

## Overview

PornSpotCoin (PSC) is a blockchain-based utility token designed to facilitate payments and rewards within the PornSpot.ai ecosystem. The token serves as both a payment method for premium subscriptions and a reward mechanism for user engagement.

## Token Fundamentals

### Blockchain Platform

**Selected**: Solana

- **Rationale**: Low transaction costs, high speed, mature ecosystem for token development
- **Token standard**: SPL Token
- **Benefits**: Fast transaction finality, cost-effective microtransactions for rewards

### Use Cases

1. **Premium Account Purchases**

   - Purchase lifetime Pro accounts
   - Pay monthly subscription fees
   - Instant account upgrade upon payment

2. **User Rewards**
   - Engagement-based token distribution
   - Real-time reward payouts for user interactions

## Economic Model

### Token Supply & Distribution

**Initial Planning Example:**

- **Target**: 1,000 lifetime Pro accounts
- **Price per account**: $1,000 USD equivalent
- **Token design**: Each token worth $1,000 USD at launch
- **Total initial value**: $1,000,000 USD

**Key Considerations (To Be Determined):**

- Total token supply
- Distribution strategy
- Initial pricing mechanism
- Inflation/deflation mechanics

### Market Making & Liquidity

**Exchange Integration:**

- **Primary targets**: Uniswap (Ethereum), PancakeSwap (BSC), or equivalent DEX platforms
- **Solana DEXs**: Integration with Serum, Raydium, or other Solana-based exchanges
- **Liquidity provision**: Strategy to be developed for initial and ongoing liquidity
- **Market making**: Mechanisms to maintain stable trading pairs

## Token Mechanics

### Burning Mechanism

- **Lifetime Pro purchases**: Tokens are permanently burned upon purchase
- **Purpose**: Deflationary pressure to maintain/increase token value
- **Tracking**: All burns recorded on-chain for transparency

### Reward System

**Dynamic Budget Allocation:**

The platform implements a sophisticated budget-based reward system with automatic daily distribution:

- **Budget Determination**: Fixed budgets are set for each time period:

  - Daily budget (e.g., 1 PSC รท 30 days = 0.033 PSC/day)
  - Weekly budget allocation
  - Monthly budget allocation (e.g., 1 PSC per month)

- **Dynamic Rate Calculation**: The system automatically adjusts reward rates based on activity volume:

  - **Low activity periods**: Higher PSC per interaction (limited users share the daily budget)
  - **High activity periods**: Lower PSC per interaction (many users share the daily budget)
  - **Budget depletion**: Daily budget must be fully distributed each day

- **Rate Tracking & Analytics**:
  - Real-time tracking of PSC/view rates
  - Historical PSC/like rates
  - PSC/comment rate analytics
  - PSC/bookmark rate monitoring
  - Price graph visualization for all interaction types

**Engagement Rewards Structure:**

- **Views**: Variable PSC rate based on daily budget and activity
- **Likes**: Variable PSC rate based on daily budget and activity
- **Comments**: Variable PSC rate based on daily budget and activity
- **Bookmarks**: Variable PSC rate based on daily budget and activity

**Implementation Details:**

- **Daily Reset**: Budget resets at midnight UTC
- **Real-time Distribution**: Rewards distributed instantly upon user interaction
- **Rate API**: Live rates available via API for transparency
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Historical rate data and trends available to users

### Account Management

**Balance Storage:**

- **Platform**: DynamoDB for off-chain balance tracking
- **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw accumulated tokens to their wallets
- **Security**: Multi-signature or other security measures for large withdrawals

## Purchase & Payment Flow

### Lifetime Pro Account Purchase

1. User selects lifetime Pro upgrade
2. Payment options: PSC tokens or traditional payment
3. If PSC: tokens transferred and immediately burned
4. Account upgraded to Pro status permanently
5. **No refunds policy** - all purchases final

### Subscription Payments

1. Monthly subscription due
2. Option to pay with PSC tokens
3. Tokens transferred to platform wallet
4. Subscription activated for billing period

## Technical Integration Requirements

### Smart Contract Development

- Token contract (ERC-20/SPL equivalent)
- Burning mechanism implementation
- Multi-signature wallet for treasury management

### Platform Integration

- **Backend**: Lambda functions for token balance management
- **Database**: DynamoDB schema for user token balances
- **Frontend**: Wallet connection and token balance display
- **Payment gateway**: Integration with blockchain networks

### Security Considerations

- Wallet security best practices
- Smart contract auditing
- Rate limiting for reward payouts
- Anti-fraud measures for engagement rewards

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Token Economics**: What's the optimal supply and distribution model?
2. **Legal Structure**: What regulatory requirements must be met?
3. **Exchange Strategy**: Which exchanges to target for listing?
4. **Liquidity Strategy**: How to bootstrap and maintain trading liquidity?
