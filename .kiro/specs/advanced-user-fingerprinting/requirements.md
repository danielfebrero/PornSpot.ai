# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an advanced user fingerprinting system designed to accurately identify and track users across multiple devices, browsers, and sessions. The primary purpose is to enforce usage quotas for GPU image generation services, ensuring that limits are applied per human user rather than per device or account. The system must be robust against common evasion techniques while maintaining legal compliance for business protection against abuse.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to accurately identify unique human users across all their devices and browsers, so that I can enforce fair usage quotas regardless of how they access my service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the service from any device THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive fingerprint combining multiple data points
2. WHEN a user switches between mobile and desktop devices THEN the system SHALL recognize them as the same user with 95%+ accuracy
3. WHEN a user switches between different browsers on the same device THEN the system SHALL maintain user identity with 90%+ accuracy
4. WHEN a user uses multiple monitors or screen configurations THEN the system SHALL account for hardware variations while maintaining identity
5. IF a user clears cookies or uses incognito mode THEN the system SHALL still identify them through alternative fingerprinting methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to collect comprehensive device and browser fingerprints from the frontend, so that I can build a robust identification profile for each user.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the application THEN the system SHALL collect browser fingerprint data including user agent, screen resolution, timezone, language preferences, and installed fonts
2. WHEN the frontend initializes THEN the system SHALL gather hardware fingerprints including CPU cores, memory, GPU information, and audio context fingerprints
3. WHEN collecting fingerprints THEN the system SHALL use canvas fingerprinting, WebGL fingerprinting, and audio context analysis
4. WHEN gathering data THEN the system SHALL collect network-related information including IP address patterns and connection characteristics
5. IF advanced fingerprinting APIs are available THEN the system SHALL utilize WebRTC, battery API, and device orientation data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to leverage AWS infrastructure for enhanced fingerprinting capabilities, so that I can improve accuracy through server-side analysis and data correlation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request passes through CloudFront THEN the system SHALL capture and analyze CloudFront headers including geographic data and edge location information
2. WHEN requests reach API Gateway THEN the system SHALL extract and store detailed request metadata including timing patterns and header analysis
3. WHEN processing fingerprints THEN the system SHALL use AWS Lambda for real-time fingerprint analysis and matching
4. WHEN storing fingerprint data THEN the system SHALL use DynamoDB for fast lookup and correlation of fingerprint patterns
5. IF multiple requests come from related fingerprints THEN the system SHALL use machine learning models to identify behavioral patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to implement persistent tracking mechanisms, so that users cannot easily evade quota enforcement through simple browser actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site THEN the system SHALL set multiple types of persistent identifiers including HTTP cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB entries
2. WHEN cookies are deleted THEN the system SHALL regenerate identifiers using stored fingerprint data and alternative storage mechanisms
3. WHEN implementing persistence THEN the system SHALL use ETags, cache headers, and service worker storage for identifier resurrection
4. WHEN a user returns after clearing data THEN the system SHALL match them against historical fingerprint patterns with statistical confidence scoring
5. IF traditional storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to pure fingerprint-based identification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to track and enforce usage quotas based on consolidated user identity, so that limits apply per human user regardless of their access method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to use a quota-limited feature THEN the system SHALL check usage against their consolidated identity across all devices and sessions
2. WHEN quota limits are reached THEN the system SHALL deny access consistently across all user devices and browsers
3. WHEN tracking usage THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate counts that cannot be reset by device switching or browser changes
4. WHEN a new device is detected for an existing user THEN the system SHALL immediately apply existing quota restrictions
5. IF quota enforcement is bypassed THEN the system SHALL log security events and implement progressive restrictions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want the fingerprinting system to be resilient against common evasion techniques, so that sophisticated users cannot easily circumvent quota enforcement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users attempt to spoof user agents THEN the system SHALL detect inconsistencies through cross-validation of multiple fingerprint components
2. WHEN VPN or proxy usage is detected THEN the system SHALL maintain user identity through non-IP-based fingerprinting methods
3. WHEN browser extensions modify fingerprints THEN the system SHALL identify and compensate for common anti-fingerprinting tools
4. WHEN users employ virtual machines THEN the system SHALL detect VM signatures and maintain tracking through hardware-independent methods
5. IF automated tools or bots are detected THEN the system SHALL implement enhanced verification and blocking mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want comprehensive logging and analytics of fingerprinting data, so that I can monitor system effectiveness and improve accuracy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fingerprints are collected THEN the system SHALL log all data points with timestamps and confidence scores
2. WHEN user matching occurs THEN the system SHALL record match confidence levels and contributing factors
3. WHEN quota enforcement actions are taken THEN the system SHALL log the decision rationale and fingerprint evidence
4. WHEN analyzing system performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on accuracy rates, false positives, and evasion attempts
5. IF patterns indicate system gaming THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest countermeasures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want the fingerprinting system to maintain legal compliance and user privacy protections, so that the business can operate within regulatory frameworks while preventing abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting fingerprint data THEN the system SHALL implement data minimization principles and collect only necessary information for quota enforcement
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data retention policies and secure storage practices
3. WHEN users request information THEN the system SHALL provide transparency about data collection and usage for quota enforcement purposes
4. WHEN implementing tracking THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws while maintaining business protection capabilities
5. IF regulatory requirements change THEN the system SHALL be adaptable to meet new compliance standards while preserving core functionality
