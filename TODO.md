## Error handling

### Error boundary at component level

At some point, I deleted an album without deleting its comments, which caused some pages to crash.

## UI/UX

### Sticky footer actions on mobile for /user pages

Like on a native app, show Profile, Likes, Bookmarks etc with buttons in a sticky footer on mobile.
On tablet, we could have a sticky footer with text and icons.

### Swap medias in Lightbox

When viewing a media in lightbox, we should be able to swap the media with the next or previous one. Like on Tinder.

## User profile

## Videos and Gifs

### Components should be able to play videos and gifs

On click on the video icon, when being on media page or lightbox, it should show the video component or play the gif. Also, we should avoid Gifs maybe because they are really heavy.
