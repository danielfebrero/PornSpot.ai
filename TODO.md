## Error handling

### Error boundary at component level

## UI/UX

### Sticky footer actions on mobile for /user pages

Like on a native app, show Profile, Likes, Bookmarks etc with buttons in a sticky footer on mobile.
On tablet, we could have a sticky footer with text and icons.

### Opening an album from the discover page should show a loding indicator

When opening an album from the discover page, it should show a loading indicator until the album is fully loaded. Eventually, apply to other pages as well. Also, we could show a skeleton loader for the album page.
