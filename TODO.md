## Error handling

## UI/UX

### Rework Welcome email

The "what you can do now" section is not coherent and should be reworked.

### Auto connect the user when he verifies his email

When the user clicks the verification link, he should be automatically logged in.

### Improve skeleton

Currently, the backward and share buttons are on the edge sides instead of being in the container.

### Content card should automatically detect the best media to display depending on the container size

The content card should automatically choose the best media to display based on the container size, rather than using an algo based on columns/viewport. Preferred size must have predominance over the algorithm.

## User profile

Users should be able to upload an avatar image.

## Videos

### In lightbox, the video preview should be fullscreen like image

Currently, the video preview is of the size of the video.
