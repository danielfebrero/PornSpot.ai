# TODO list

## User Insights

## Homepage Discover

## User Bookmarks page

## Content Cards

### When not logged in and try to like/bookmark, we need a visual feedback

Currently, nothing happens.

### On hover/tap an album card, I want to see changing thumbnails

When hovering or tapping on an album card, the thumbnail should change to another media of the album thumbnail, every 1 seconds. This will provide a more dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Error handling

### Write tests

I suggest to delete all the tests and write new ones. The current tests are not up to date and do not cover all the functionality. We should write tests for all the components, hooks, and utilities. Both frontend and backend should have tests.

## UI/UX

### Rework Welcome email

The "what you can do now" section is not coherent and should be reworked.

## User profile

## Videos

## Admin

### Dashboard page should show stats of global app

Refactor the admin dashboard to show stats and analytics for the entire application, not just the admin's own content. This will provide a better overview of the app's performance.

### All media page

We should implement an "All Media" page in the admin section to allow admins to view and manage all media content in one place.

### All albums page

Make sure the album page return all albums, not just the ones created by the user. This will allow admins to manage all albums effectively.

## Settings

## User Profile

## User albums

### Delete album tooltip in dropdown should appear on one line

The tooltip for deleting an album in the dropdown menu should be displayed on a single line for better readability and user experience.

## Optimization

### Translate all hardcoded strings

We should extract all hardcoded strings in the application and replace them with next-intl keys.

### Make tanstack leverage ssg data

We should optimize our use of TanStack to leverage Static Site Generation (SSG) data effectively. This will improve performance and reduce the load on our servers.

## Comments
