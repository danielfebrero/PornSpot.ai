# TODO

## Error handling

### Write tests

I suggest to delete all the tests and write new ones. The current tests are not up to date and do not cover all the functionality. We should write tests for all the components, hooks, and utilities. Both frontend and backend should have tests.

### Never use any

We should avoid using `any` type in TypeScript. Instead, we should define proper types for our data structures.

## UI/UX

### âœ… ~~Pressing backward button on the lightbox page should close it~~

**COMPLETED**: Implemented browser back button handling in the Lightbox component with proper history management. When the lightbox is open, pressing the browser's back button now closes the lightbox instead of navigating to the previous page. The implementation:

- Adds a dummy history entry when the lightbox opens
- Listens for `popstate` events to intercept back button navigation
- Uses a wrapped `onClose` function to clean up history entries when closed programmatically
- Maintains proper browser history flow after the lightbox is closed
- Includes comprehensive E2E tests to verify the behavior

### Make admin page responsive

Currently, it's unusable on mobile devices. We need to ensure that the admin page is fully responsive and functional on smaller screens.

### Rework Welcome email

The "what you can do now" section is not coherent and should be reworked.

### Auto connect the user when he verifies his email

When the user clicks the verification link, he should be automatically logged in.

### Improve skeleton

Currently, the backward and share buttons are on the edge sides instead of being in the container.

## User profile

## Videos

### In lightbox, the video preview should be fullscreen like image

Currently, the video preview is of the size of the video.

## Admin

## Settings

## User albums

## Optimization

### http://localhost:3001/user/interactions/status should support bulk requests

Currently, we send one request per media, it's not efficient. We should support bulk requests to reduce the number of API calls.
