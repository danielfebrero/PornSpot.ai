## Error handling

## UI/UX

### Make admin page responsive

Currently, it's unusable on mobile devices. We need to ensure that the admin page is fully responsive and functional on smaller screens.

### Rework Welcome email

The "what you can do now" section is not coherent and should be reworked.

### Auto connect the user when he verifies his email

When the user clicks the verification link, he should be automatically logged in.

Currently, the backward and share buttons are on the edge sides instead of being in the container.
