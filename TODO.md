## Error handling

### Error boundary at component level

At some point, I deleted an album without deleting its comments, which caused some pages to crash.

## UI/UX

### Sticky footer actions on mobile for /user pages

Like on a native app, show Profile, Likes, Bookmarks etc with buttons in a sticky footer on mobile.
On tablet, we could have a sticky footer with text and icons.
