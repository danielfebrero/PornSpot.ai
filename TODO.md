# TODO

## Error handling

### Write tests

I suggest to delete all the tests and write new ones. The current tests are not up to date and do not cover all the functionality. We should write tests for all the components, hooks, and utilities. Both frontend and backend should have tests.

### Never use any

We should avoid using `any` type in TypeScript. Instead, we should define proper types for our data structures.

## UI/UX

### Make admin page responsive

Currently, it's unusable on mobile devices. We need to ensure that the admin page is fully responsive and functional on smaller screens.

### Rework Welcome email

The "what you can do now" section is not coherent and should be reworked.

### Auto connect the user when he verifies his email

When the user clicks the verification link, he should be automatically logged in.

### Improve skeleton

Currently, the backward and share buttons are on the edge sides instead of being in the container.

## User profile

### On media page, the cardcontent view counter is not working

The view counter always shows 0 while it works on other pages.

## Videos

### In lightbox, the video preview should be fullscreen like image

Currently, the video preview is of the size of the video.

## Admin

## Settings

## User albums

## Optimization

## Comments

## Infrastructure

### Migrate to Terraform

We should migrate our infrastructure to Terraform for better management and scalability.

### Migrate to Next.js 15

We should upgrade our Next.js version to 15 to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.

### Migrate to React.js 19

We should upgrade our React.js version to 19 to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.
